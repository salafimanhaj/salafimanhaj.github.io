### Question: 

What is the ruling on saying that Allah (Glorified be He) exists everywhere?

### Answer: 

Saying that Allah exists in all places is the saying of the atheist Al-Hululiyyah (a Sufi sect that believes in indwelling). The foregoing is a false saying and it is tantamount to Kufr (disbelief) in Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). 

This is because Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) is above His heavens rising over the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty). He (Exalted be He) is too exalted for indwelling in any of His Creatures. He is free of all wants and needs, while all His Creatures stand in need of Him.

He (Exalted be He) says: “**Verily, Allâh grasps the heavens and the earth lest they should move away from their places**” [Qur'an, Fatir: 41] and: “**He withholds the heaven from falling on the earth except by His Leave.**” [Qur'qn, Al-Hajj: 65] Besides, He (Exalted be He) says: “**Indeed, your Lord is Allâh, Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days, and then He rose over (Istawâ) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty).**” [Qur'an, Al-A’raf: 54] And: “**So the judgement is only with Allâh, the Most High, the Most Great!**” [Qur'an, Ghafir: 12]. He (Exalted be He) also says: “**The Most Gracious (Allâh) rose over (Istawâ) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty).**” [Qur'an, TaHa: 5] 

There are many other Ayahs (Qur’anic verses) to the same effect.
