### Question: 
Is it correct for women when kissing the Black Stone to uncover their faces even though there are men around them?

### Answer: 
Kissing the Black Stone during tawaf is one of the established Sunnahs of tawaf, if it is possible to do it without pushing and shoving or annoying anyone else by your action, following the example of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). If it is not possible to kiss the black stone except by pushing and shoving and annoying others, then one should not do it, and it is sufficient to point to it with one's hand, especially for women, because the woman is `awrah and because pushing and shoving is not allowed for men, so it is even less so for women.
