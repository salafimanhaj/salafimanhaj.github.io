### Question: 

Can you mention to the listeners the things which take out a person from the Din (religion) of Islam, make him a Kafir (disbeliever) after being a Muslim?

### Answer: 

There are certain matters that nullify Islam. A Muslim is obliged to be cautious about these things. Scholars have mentioned them in the chapter of the ruling on the Murtad (apostate). They defined them as the Muslim who becomes a Kafir after his Islam. They mentioned many things which nullify one's Islam, for example, invoking the dead, seeking help from them, cursing the Din of Islam, the Prophet (peace be upon him), or the Qur'an, mocking the Qur'an, or the Din of Islam, neglecting Salahs (Prayers), denying its obligation, denying the obligation of Zakah (obligatory charity), denying the obligation of Sawm (Fast) in Ramadan, denying the obligation of Hajj for he who has the ability to perform it. Those who deny these obligations are Kafirs. Also, those who deem as lawful Zina (illegal sexual intercourse outside marriage), homosexuality are Kafirs. If one says that Khamr (intoxicant) is Halal (lawful), then he becomes a Kafir. If he says that Riba (usury) is Halal, he is a Kafir. 

There are also many other examples mentioned by scholars in this regard. They referred to them as nullifiers of Islam, which cause Riddah (apostasy). May Allah protect us. These times are hard times, particularly in many countries which are not ruled by the Shari'ah (Islamic law), with many advocators of falsehood. The deeds which nullify Islam are widely spread. There is neither might nor power except with Allah.
